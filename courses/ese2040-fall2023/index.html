<h2>Course description</h2>
<p>This first course in decision making will introduce you to quantitative models for decision and design in the sciences, engineering, machine learning, data science, logistics, and economics.  Through application-based case studies, you will be shown how to (i) formalize a decision problem as a mathematical optimization problem, and (ii) solve the resulting optimization problem using Python scientific computing modules.  You will also be given a brief introduction to the optimization algorithms and programming tools underpinning contemporary deep learning and shown how to apply them to decision and design problems.</p>
<h2>About the Course</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>The only official prerequisites for this class is Math 1400.  Basic familiarity with Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices) and Python and programming is helpful, but not necessary.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Homework (50%)</b>: there will be 9 homework assignments.  They will be assigned weekly, handed out on Thursday at 1pm and due the following Thursday at 1pm.  There will be suitable breaks in assignments to accommodate exams and the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.  Assignments will include both conceptual (written) and implementation (programming) exercises. You will be given 5 free late days which you may use as you please throughout the semester, after which no late assignments will be accepted.  Each homework problem will be graded on a scale of 0-2: no points are awarded for a skipped problem, 1 point for a solid attempt, and 2 points for a mostly correct solution. </p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Midterm exam 1 (25%)</b>: the midterm will consist of an in-class written component (15%) and a take-home computational component (10%).  The in-class component will be closed-book and closed-notes. However, you will be allowed a single sheet of standard-sized paper with you with anything you want written on it (double-sided). No electronic devices are allowed.  The take-home component of the exam will be open book.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Midterm exam 2 (25%)</b>: the midterm will consist of an in-class written component on the last day of classes (15%) and a take-home computational component (10%) due one week later.  The in-class component will be closed-book and closed-notes. However, you will be allowed a single sheet of standard-sized paper with you with anything you want written on it (double-sided). No electronic devices are allowed.  The take-home component of the exam will be open book.</p>
